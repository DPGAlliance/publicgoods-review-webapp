<h1> hello </h1> 

# This repo hosts the code for the Digital Public Goods Alliance Webapp 
At the user end, the Webapp provides a platform for open source digital products to submit their applications to be accepted as Digital Public Goods.
At the back end, the Webapp provides a mechanism for the DPGA team to evaluate, accept, reject, and monitor the submissions. It allows DPGA reviewers to loop in experts for more nuanced opinions as well as get in touch with nominees for further clarifications.
The Webapp keeps track of the number of DPG applications being processed per day and logs every action taken on a submitted application from a reviewer, expert or admin panel.
Updating this project is useful in ensuring that we are following the best practices in evaluating applications and that each application is complying with the latest standards set out by the DPGA board. Once an application is approved, it is listed on our registry, where governments, ministries and private stakeholders can discover and implement them. 
Our aim is to have 50 countries deploying at least 1 DPG each in the next 5 years. We need everyoneâ€™s help if we want to build a more tech-inclusive world and attain the SDGs set out by the United Nations for 2030. 
We actively encourage people to contribute to this project. Please see our Contributing Guidelines to learn more about how you can participate. You can also get involved with the larger DPGA ecosystem in various ways. 
Lastly, welcome to our community - DPG Evangelists and Creators of a more inclusive world! We are glad to have you here!
