<h1 align="center"> Digital Public Goods Webapp </h1> 

<h3> üëã Hello! </h3> 

Welcome to the repository which hosts the code for the Digital Public Goods Alliance Webapp! 

The frontend of the Webapp can be found [here](https://app.digitalpublicgoods.net/signup).     

<h3> üîé What does the webapp do? </h3> 

At the *user end*, the Webapp provides a platform for open source digital products to submit their applications to be accepted as [Digital Public Goods](https://digitalpublicgoods.net). 

At the *back end*, the Webapp provides a mechanism for the DPGA team to evaluate, accept, reject, and monitor the submissions. It allows DPGA reviewers to loop in experts for more nuanced opinions as well as get in touch with nominees for further clarifications.

The Webapp also keeps track of the number of DPG applications being processed per day and logs every action taken on a submitted application from a reviewer, expert or admin panel.


<h3> ‚úÖ Why is this project important? </h3> 

Updating this project is useful in ensuring that we are following the best practices in evaluating applications and that each application is complying with the latest [standards](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/standard/) set out by the DPGA board. Once an application is approved, it is listed on our [registry](https://digitalpublicgoods.net/registry/), where governments, ministries and private stakeholders can discover and implement them. 


<h3>  üôãüèΩ What is our aim and how can you help? </h3> 

Our aim is to have 50 countries deploying at least 1 DPG each in the next 5 years. We need everyone‚Äôs help if we want to build a more tech-inclusive world and attain the [SDGs](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) set out by the United Nations for 2030. 

**We *actively* encourage people to contribute to this project.**
