<h2 id="Cookiespolicy"><b>Cookies policy</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By visiting or using this web application (DPGA Web Application), a cookie will be created which the Digital Public Goods Alliance may use to provide statistics that help us to give you the best experience of our sites. The statement below describes our policy on cookies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do not agree with any of the following, you can switch off the cookies. However, by continuing to use our sites without changing settings, you are agreeing to our use of cookies.</span></p>
<h4><b>What is a cookie?</b></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the course of any visit to our websites, the pages which you see, along with something called a cookie, are downloaded to your computer. Most, if not all, websites do this, and that&rsquo;s because cookies allow the website publisher to do useful things like find out whether the computer (and probably its user) has visited the site before. This is done on a repeat visit by checking to see, and finding, the cookie left there on the last visit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So &ndash; what is a cookie? When you enter a site your computer will automatically be issued with a cookie. Cookies are text files which identify your computer to our server. Cookies in themselves do not identify the individual user, just the computer used. Many sites do this whenever a user visits their site, in order to track traffic flows. Cookies themselves only record which areas of the site have been visited by the computer in question, and for how long. Users have the opportunity to set their computers to accept all cookies, to notify them when a cookie is issued, or not to receive cookies at any time, although this of course means that certain personalised services cannot then be provided to that user. You should read the information that came with your browser software to see how you can do this. Even assuming you have not set your computer to reject cookies, you can browse our sites anonymously until such time as you register your information with the Digital Public Goods Alliance.</span></p>
<h5><b>What do cookies tell us?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use cookies to collect data for analytics, such as demographic and interest data, based on your browsing patterns. This data allows us to estimate your age range, your gender and things that might interest you.</span></p>
<h5><b>What do we use cookies for?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use cookies so that we can give you a better experience when you return to our websites. In particular, we use cookies to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">better understand our audience and supporters, for example by estimating our audience size and patterns and tracking the level of interest in our campaigns;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">track your preferences and personalise the sites to your requirements and interests;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">avoid lengthy registration/personalisation on each visit;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">improve and update our websites.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Specifically for the DPGA Web Application, we use cookies to "remember" you and autosave the information that you are inputting to the form; so that we can restore a partially filled form if your session is interrupted.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h5><b>How do we collect and analyze cookies?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Digital Public Goods Alliance uses a specialist service provider which both collects information on your preferences from your visits to our websites and analyzes your preferences from cookies already stored in your browser.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We obtain this information by enabling Google Analytics to analyze the traffic on our websites via "Google Advertising Cookies". Google Advertising Cookies are a series of cookies already stored in your browser that compile data from your browsing preferences. You can see the types of cookies used by Google and learn more about the different categories in the </span><a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/types"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google privacy &amp; terms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may change our specialist service provider at any time without notice to you and will update this Policy as necessary at that time.</span></p>
<h5><b>What can you do if you do not want us to use your cookies?</b></h5>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Configure how we use your </span><a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Analytics information</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you would like to opt out of all Google Analytics tracking services then you can install an Add-on. </span><a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Find out about more about Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively, you can use your browsers&rsquo; private browsing mode. Common browsers like Google Chrome, Brave, Safari and Internet Explorer have this functionality. Bear in mind that in doing so, you will also lose the ability to restore a previous session, and you will have to start from the beginning in the case that your browsing session is interrupted.</span></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>How do I opt-out of the collection and use of information for promotional purposes generally?</b></h5>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are many websites that provide guidance on how to opt out of the collection and use of your information for promotional purposes that are not limited to the Digital Public Goods Alliance web properties. For example:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="http://www.google.com/settings/ads"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Google Ads settings</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Network Advertising Initiative opt-out page</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><a href="http://optout.aboutads.info/#!/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Advertising Alliance&rsquo;s Consumer Choice Tool</span></a></li>
</ul>
<h5><b>Do you share data from cookies with other organizations?</b></h5>
